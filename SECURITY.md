# Security Policy — ESP32-LABs

ESP32-LABs intentionally contains insecure code and misconfigurations for educational and laboratory exercises. Before reporting, please confirm whether the issue is an intentional lab vulnerability described in the repository documentation.

If you believe you have found a genuine security vulnerability in the project code that could lead to real-world impact outside the controlled lab context (for example, a bug that leaks secrets or can be reproduced in production deployments), please report it privately to the maintainers.

## Reporting a security issue

Send an email to: arn-c0de@protonmail.com

Include the following information:
- A short, descriptive subject line.
- Affected versions or commit SHA.
- Steps to reproduce the issue and a minimal proof-of-concept if possible.
- Expected and actual behavior, and potential impact.
- Suggested mitigation or patch if available.

If you prefer to use encrypted email, indicate this in your message and we will provide a public key or alternate secure channel.

## Response and disclosure timeline

- Acknowledgement: within 5 business days.
- Initial triage and recommended mitigation: within 15 business days if the issue is confirmed.
- Coordinated disclosure: We will work with the reporter to determine an appropriate disclosure timeline based on severity.

## Important notes

- This project is explicitly designed for controlled, educational use. Do not attempt to exploit lab instances on networks you do not own or have permission to test.
- If your report concerns third-party libraries or upstream components, we may forward the report to the appropriate maintainers.
